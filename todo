STORE/LOAD injection point
    use opcode for the type

CONSTANT injection point
    use target for the constant
    "null" for null
    "type;value" for the rest

add @At offset

mixinclass @ModifyValue - method, @At
    get the real type by the last opcode before the inject point

    if target is static
        1st parameter: the type of the value to change
    if target is not static
        1st parameter: the targets type
        2nd parameter: the type of the value to change
