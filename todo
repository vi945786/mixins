STORE/LOAD injection point
    use target for the type //check the local variable table for the type

CONSTANT injection point
    use target for the constant
    "null" for null
    "type;value" for the rest

make @Inject support method names without desc
make @Shadow, @New, @Getter, @Setter, @Invoker, Overridable support not taking a value based on the element's name/desc
add @At offset

@Redirect - method/field, @At (INVOKE/FIELD)
    calls the annotated method instead of the original
    for static the same args and return
    for non-static the same args and return but add the type of the instance (or object)
    for constructors same args but return the constructed type

@ModifyValue - method, @At
    HEAD for modifying args or STORE/LOAD for modifying locals/args //check the local variable table for the type
    TAIL/RETURN for getting and changing the return value
    CONSTANT for changing constants

    1 parameter: the type of the value to change
    returns the new value

@Local - type (optional), ordinal (optional)
    //check the local variable table for the type
    on a parameter after the last parameter (can have as many as you want)
    should work on @Inject, @Redirect, @ModifyArg, @ModifyArgs, @ModifyValue
